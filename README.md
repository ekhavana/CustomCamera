Custom Camera App - Xcode 9 | Swift 4 - Simply of Tutorial

I'm building a custom camera app with Xcode 9 | Swift 4 based on tutorial from Zero2Launch.io

Swift 4 and iOS 11 are shipped with the game-changing Core Machine Learning (Core ML) SDK which allows developers to build "smart" apps. So far, pre-trained Core ML models typically require visual inputs such as photos and videos. As such, building a beautiful custom camera to visually capture the world is the first, and crucial, step towards building such intelligent apps. You'll master this task in this series.
